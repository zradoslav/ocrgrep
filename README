# isbn_extractor

Usage: isbn_extract [-v] -t type -n pages [-l lang] [-f] file

isbn_extractor's purpose is obvious.
It is OCR powered and consumes resources a lot.

Dependencies
------------
This program was originally developed against
* tesseract v4.0.0
* djvulibre v3.5.27
* libmupdf v1.14.0

For some distro specific reason, libmupdf is linked statically.

TODO
----
* check for embedded text in PDF/DJVU
* reduce memory usage (now: page_count * page_size)
* add more formats (PS, DVI, ...)
* use different OCR engine?
